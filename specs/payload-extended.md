# Payload Extended Data Specification

This page formally specifies the Extended Data Payload. This is referenced in both the
[Simple Payload Specification]({{"/specs/payload-simple" | relative_url }}) and the
[Secured Payload Specification]({{"/specs/payload-secured" | relative_url }}) and the
[Beacon Payload Specification]({{"/payload/payload-beacon" | relative_url }}).

This specification is a **DRAFT**

## Modal verbs terminology

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL 
NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and
"OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
[RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).

Note that these terms apply whether they are uppercase or lowercase
and no matter what styles are applied to the phrases.

## References

### Normative references

References are either specific (identified by date of publication and/or edition number or version number) or non specific. For specific references,only the cited version applies. For non-specific references, the latest version of the referenced document (including any amendments) applies.

The following referenced documents are necessary for the application of the present document.

### Information references

References are either specific (identified by date of publication and/or edition number or version number) or non specific. For specific references,only the cited version applies. For non-specific references, the latest version of the referenced document (including any amendments) applies.

The following referenced documents are not necessary for the application of the present document but they assist the user with regard to a particular subject area.

## Definition of terms, symbols and abbreviations

### Terms

**Beacon** - A fixed device in a location that provides location-specific information. May be called a Bluetooth Beacon.

**Big Endian** - Also known as 'Network Order'. A way of encoding numeric values for transport over data networks. Bluetooth (and most network protocols) are Big Endian.

**Herald Project** - The opensource contributors and maintainers of the Herald website, code, and standards documents.

### Symbols

### Abbreviations

## Design Constraints

The below are the constraints placed on the design of the system that the rest of this standard is defined within.



## Lifecycle Summary








## Packet data format

Note all values are Big Endian (Network Order) and optional by default.

  A(Data Code<br>1 byte<br>0x00-0x3F<br>Reserved<br>_) --> B(Data Length<br> <br>1 byte<br>uint8<br>_)
  B-->C(Data<br><br>1+ bytes<br>binary<br>_)
@endmermaid

Note there may be multiple sections. Below is an example showing three extended data sections:-

  C -.-> D(Data Code<br>1 byte<br>0x02<br>RSSI error<br>_) --> E(Data Length<br>1 byte<br>1<br> <br>_)
  E --> F(  Data  <br>1 byte <br>2<br> <br>_)
  F -.-> G(Data Code<br>1 byte<br>0x05<br>Approx Geo<br>_) --> H(Data Length<br>1 byte<br>3<br> <br>_)
  H --> I(  Data  <br>4 bytes<br>S41<br> <br>_)

## Data values supported

Any data item with no value should not be included in the data payload. 
I.e. 0 byte length extended segments are omitted.
