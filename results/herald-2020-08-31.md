# 2020-08-31

A formal test on 10 phones (5 iOS, 5 Android) carried out on 31st August 2020
by Adam Fowler of the Herald Protocol development team.

## Correction - 2020-11-07

After reviewing the fair efficacy paper it was found that the UK population with
mobile phones was double counted for some age groups. This has now been corrected
in the below statistics and the paper.

This resulted in the Pcountry value for the UK changing. This doesn't affect
the probability of accurate risk detection but does effect the final
Pspec and efficacy scores. The values that have changed are marked with an
asterisk below.
