# 2021-03-22

A formal test was carried out for Alberta TraceTogether v2.0 just prior to release. 
With the agreement of Alberta Health the Herald project are publishing the results here.

The test consisted of ten phones. One phone (iPhone7+) failed during the test and has been discounted from the results.
The likelihood is that the true results are, therefore, better than quoted here.

It should be noted that the results on this page are tuned for mobile phone use in Canada whereas all other standard
Herald tests are for the UK.

## OpenABM Simulation

The below shows the effect on COVID-19 spread of 100% adoption of the application under test, and 80% conformance to self-isolation advice. Note: The simulation still shows a control effect on COVID-19 spread with lower app uptake.
