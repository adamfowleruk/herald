# API docs

The APIs are all documented and can be found at the below locations:-

- [Android JavaDoc API]({{"/api/android/index.html" | relative_url }})
- [iOS Swift API]({{"/api/ios/index.html" | relative_url }})
- [C++]({{"/api/cpp/namespaces.html" | relative_uri}})

## Class diagrams

Class diagrams as well as Personae can be found in the following location:-

- Archimate for Herald [HTML]({{"/documents/architecture/index.html" | relative_uri}}) [Archi archimate file]({{"/documents/herald-architecture.archimate" | relative_uri}})

These are based on the C++ API which is the primary reference API, but the 
names and design are consistent across all language and platforms.

Archi is an open source Archimate diagramming tool.
