Herald performs distance estimations every few seconds, with higher frequency on modern phones. This allows for a more accurate data and risk picture over time. Maximum frequency can be configured to optimise battery use. At [~4s per reading battery use is 6-11% over 8 hours]({{"/efficacy/herald" | relative_url }})), depending on the age of the phone and its battery capacity.
