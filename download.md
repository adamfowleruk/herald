You can download a Herald release from the below URLs. Each repository has its own specific issue tracker. A list of all projects can be found on 
[The Herald Project's GitHub Organisation page](https://github.com/theheraldproject).

You can also reach out to us and log general project and research data requests and issues on our [GitHub issues site](https://github.com/theheraldproject/theheraldproject.github.io/issues). This website is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License.

The Herald project is maintained primarily by the opensource community in our spare time. We aim to respond to logged issues and emails within 24-28 hours during week days (Monday-Friday) in the UK time zone.
