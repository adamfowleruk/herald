# Herald Research

The Herald project team conduct primary research in to many areas of
science around digital contact tracing and eHealth in general.

We have also written papers on some subjects. Elsewhere we've published
information on issues we've found with exsiting technology.

## Digital Contact Tracing (DCT) Fair Efficacy Formula

The [Fair Efficacy Formula paper]({{"/efficacy/paper" | relative_url }}) provides a way of
fairly measuring and comparing different DCT applications and protocols.
The results from this can then be used to simulate and predict the control
effect possible on the spread of a disease.
