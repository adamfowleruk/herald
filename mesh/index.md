# Herald and Bluetooth MESH Introduction

Bluetooth MESH is a secure multi-node network standard from the Bluetooth SIG.
MESH builds on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to provide a way to network multiple
Bluetooth capable devices to each other.

The main use foreseen by the Bluetooth SIG is for Smart Buildings. In this
use case multiple lighting controls are managed as groups from one or more
controls.

In Herald we're interested in the technology of Bluetooth MESH to facilitate
Smart Hospital and public health use cases. The Bluetooth SIG foresaw these
uses and allow 'Vendor specific models'.
