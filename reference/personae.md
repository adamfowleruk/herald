# Personae documentation

Personae are the types of people and roles we expect to be our adopters and users of Herald
based solutions.

We use personae for every feature request to enable us to build up an understanding of our
users (both citizens with DCT apps, and app developers, and even website users). This helps
us write more relevant software and concentrate on high-value roadmap items.

Herald's Personae details can be found in our 
[Archi personae diagram]({{"/documents/architecture/id-c4bba3876a1b48d186c73843f80dfbf6/views/id-91fdc3c49fe543dd8d92431b40d176ba.html" | relative_url }}). 
Note that the Personae in this diagram can be clicked on for a description.

We also have full [architecture documentation]({{"/reference/arch" | relative_url }}) if required.
