# How to Contribute

If you would like to contribute to our open source repositories then you are more than welcome! 
Here we discuss our release process, how to create a fork and work on a feature, and importantly
how to apply our coding styles to the various repositories.

If you just wish to use Herald, rather than contribute modifications to our projects, please visit the [Developer and Integration Guide]({{"/guide" | relative_url }}) instead.

## Getting Started

You will need to do the following things. You can jump ahead, or just click 'Next' to continue
through the contributors guide.

- [Determine which repository you wish to work on]({{"/contribute/repos" | relative_url }})
- [Fork]({{"/contribute/fork" | relative_url }}) the repository
- [Create a GitFlow branch]({{"/contribute/branch" | relative_url }}) for the 'feature' you wish to work on
- [Apply coding style guidelines]({{"/contribute/style" | relative_url }}) to your work
- [Committing your contribution]({{"/contribute/commit" | relative_url }})
- [Issuing a Pull Request (PR)]({{"/contribute/pullrequest" | relative_url }})

Continue in this guide by visiting: [Determine which repository you wish to work on]({{"/contribute/repos" | relative_url }}).
