As part of Herald's formal adoption by the Linux Foundation we're about to start migrating
our code repositories, website, and communication channels. This blog gives you a 'heads up'
on the changes coming soon.

### By the end of March 2021

- Code repositories move to [our new GitHub org](https://github.com/theheraldproject)
- Slack channels created on the [LFPH Slack instance](https://slack.lfph.io), and our own Herald one shut down for new content contributions

### By mid-April 2021

- Website moved from vmware.github.io/herald to theheraldproject.github.io but shown on our new domain of https://heraldprox.io/

We hope these changes help build a
We're community driven, so please come and [join the Herald community]({{"/community" | relative_url }}) 
and help us build the future of the Herald project!
