# Introducing the Herald Bluetooth MESH API

The Herald Bluetooth MESH API will allow Smart Hospital use cases, improving the experience of clinical staff, patients, and visitors.

The Herald Project contributors have been looking at how we can take what we've learned during COVID-19 about
Bluetooth Low Energy and apply it to a wider healthcare context. 
[Herald Bluetooth MESH](/mesh) is a new API that facilitates easy creation of a secure MESH network
within a hospital. This can drive many use cases, including:-

- Navigation without a hospital, with downloadable and searchable map and gazetteer
- Locating hospital equipment by staff when they urgently need it
- Replacing pagers with a secure, in-hospital, self healing data network, providing more patient context in messages

The Herald Bluetooth MESH API is currently under development with the technology already running on a variety
of devices and communicating between computer servers running the RabbitMQ reliable messaging technology,
and a set of Herald MESH applications including a MESH Modem, MESH network Relay Nodes (which also support
the Herald Venue Beacon functionality), and MESH and Bluetooth Low Energy 'tags' for equipment.

We hope to release a first Beta demonstration build of applications with a video explainer in May 2022.
