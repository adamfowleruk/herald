The Herald Project team are pleased to announce the publication of our first
dataset from our Edison distance calibration robot. This robot allows two phones
to be placed at a precise distance in a controlled setting and moved distance
over time. 

This provides for a very rich dataset of RSSI readings for known devices at
known distances.

The Herald team hope this data will allow researchers to come up with new 
and novel ways to provide accurate distance estimations from Bluetooth RSSI data.

Notes about the data set:-

- Collected from a pair of phones. One static, the other which is moved to a fixed distance by the Edison robot
- RSSI is a raw RSSI from the local phones Bluetooth Chipset via the advertisement from the remote phone
- Both phones were running the standard Herald Protocol and Fixed Payload demonstration application
- Phones were then left alone to record the data, and moved by the Edison robot over time
- No modification has occurred to the raw rssi readings (no calibration/alteration)
- Contains 634574 RSSI readings in this dataset
- Distances range from 0-200cm in 25 cm divisions
- Accelerometer data was used to detect movement, and those data points have been removed from the above dataset

You can find our reference data at the below locations:-

- [Description of all reference data](https://github.com/vmware/herald-analysis/tree/develop/reference-data)

We aim to publish more data soon, including accelerometer data for test subject phones,
Bluetooth Beacon and Wearable RSSI readings with these phones, and code for Colin the Calibration robot.
